# PHP MySQLi Migration: Replacing Deprecated mysql_* Functions

This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP code: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions. These functions are insecure and have been removed from recent PHP versions.

The `bug.php` file contains code using the outdated `mysql_*` functions. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a secure and updated version using the `mysqli_*` functions.

## Problem

Using deprecated functions like `mysql_connect`, `mysql_query`, and `mysql_fetch_array` poses several risks:

* **Security vulnerabilities:**  Outdated functions lack modern security features and are susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
* **Lack of support:**  These functions are no longer actively maintained and may not work correctly with newer PHP versions.
* **Reduced performance:** Modern alternatives provide better performance and efficiency.

## Solution

The recommended approach is to migrate to the `mysqli_*` functions or, even better, to use Prepared Statements for enhanced security.

The `bugSolution.php` file shows how to replace the deprecated code with the secure and updated `mysqli_*` functions.
